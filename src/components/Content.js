        The tortoise and the hare decided to have a race. The hare was very confident
        because he was fast, while the tortoise moved slowly and steadily.

        During the race, the hare ran far ahead and decided to take a nap, believing
        he would still win easily. Meanwhile, the tortoise continued walking without
        stopping.

        While the hare slept, the tortoise reached the finish line first. The hare
        woke up too late and lost the race.
